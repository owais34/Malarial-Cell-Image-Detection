# Malarial-Cell-Image-Detection
Detection of Malarial cells using CNN implemented using the Keras library.

This is a kaggle dataset and can be found on the following link

## Introduction 

Here are some infected cell samples.

And here are some healthy cells.

As we can see it is not possible to differntiate between the cells with the normal human eye

Hence here Machine Learning algorithms can have a lot importance.
